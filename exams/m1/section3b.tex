\mysection{Section 3.B Null Spaces and Ranges}

\defi{null space}
For $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W),$ the null space of $T,$ denoted null $T,$ is the subset of $V$ consisting of those vectors that $T$ maps to 0 :
$$
\text { null } T=\{v \in V: T v=0\}
$$

\defi{injective}
A function $T: V \rightarrow W$ is called injective if $T u=T v$ implies $u=v$

\thrm{Injectivity is equivalent to null space equals $ \{0\} $}
Let $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W) .$ Then $T$ is injective if and only if null $T=\{0\}$

\defi{range}
For $T$ a function from $V$ to $W,$ the range of $T$ is the subset of $W$ consisting of those vectors that are of the form $T v$ for some $v \in V:$
$$
\text { range } T=\{T v: v \in V\}
$$

\thrm{The range is subspace}
If $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W),$ then range $T$ is a subspace of $W$

\defi{surjective}
A function $T: V \rightarrow W$ is called surfective if its range equals $W$

\thrm{Fundamental Theorem of Linear Maps}
Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W) .$ Then range $T$ is finite-dimensional and
$$
\operatorname{dim} V=\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{null} T+\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{range} T
$$

\thrm{A map to a smaller dimensional space is not injective}
Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional vector spaces such that $\operatorname{dim} V>\operatorname{dim} W .$ Then no linear map from $V$ to $W$ is injective.

\thrm{A map to a larger dimensional space is not surjective}
Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional vector spaces such that $\operatorname{dim} V<\operatorname{dim} W .$ Then no linear map from $V$ to $W$ is surjective.

\thrm{Homogeneous system of linear equations}
A homogeneous system of linear equations with more variables than equations has nonzero solutions.

\thrm{Inhomogeneous system of linear equations}
An inhomogeneous system of linear equations with more equations thavariables has no solution for some choice of the constant terms.
