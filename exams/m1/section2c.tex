\mysection{Section 2.C Dimension}

\defi{dimension, $ \dim V $}
The dimension of a finite-dimensional vector space is the length of any basis of the vector space.
The dimension of $V$ (if $V$ is finite-dimensional) is denoted by $\operatorname{dim} V$. 

\thrm{Dimension of  subspace}
If $V$ is finite-dimensional and $U$ is a subspace of $V,$ then $\operatorname{dim} U \leq \operatorname{dim} V$

\thrm{Linearly independent list of the right length is a basis}
Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional. Then every linearly independent list of vectors in $V$ with length $\operatorname{dim} V$ is a basis of $V$

\thrm{Spanning list of the right length is a basis}
Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional. Then every spanning list of vectors in $V$ with length $\operatorname{dim} V$ is a basis of $V$

\thrm{Dimension of a sum}
If $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$ are subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space, then
$$
\operatorname{dim}\left(U_{1}+U_{2}\right)=\operatorname{dim} U_{1}+\operatorname{dim} U_{2}-\operatorname{dim}\left(U_{1} \cap U_{2}\right)
$$
