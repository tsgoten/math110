\mysection{Section 3.A The Vector Space of Linear Maps}

\defi{linear map}
A linear map from $V$ to $W$ is a function $T: V \rightarrow W$ with the following properties:
additivity
$$
T(u+v)=T u+T v \text { for all } u, v \in V
$$
homogeneity
$$
T(\lambda v)=\lambda(T v) \text { for all } \lambda \in \mathbf{F} \text { and all } v \in V
$$

\defi{Notation $ \mathcal{L}(V, W) $}
The set of all linear maps from $V$ to $W$ is denoted $\mathcal{L}(V, W)$

\thrm{Linear maps and basis of domain}
Suppose $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{n}$ is a basis of $V$ and $w_{1}, \ldots, w_{n} \in W .$ Then there exists a unique linear map $T: V \rightarrow W$ such that
$$
T v_{j}=w_{j}
$$
for each $j=1, \ldots, n$

\defi{additiona nd scalar multiplication on linear maps}
Suppose $S, T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$ and $\lambda \in \mathbf{F} .$ The sum $S+T$ and the product $\lambda T$ are the linear maps from $V$ to $W$ defined by
$$
(S+T)(v)=S v+T v \quad \text { and } \quad(\lambda T)(v)=\lambda(T v)
$$
for all $v \in V$

\thrm{$\mathcal{L}(V, W) $ is a vector space}
With the operations of addition and scalar multiplication as defined above, $\mathcal{L}(V, W)$ is a vector space.

\defi{Product of Linear Maps}
If $T \in \mathcal{L}(U, V)$ and $S \in \mathcal{L}(V, W),$ then the product $S T \in \mathcal{L}(U, W)$ is defined by
$$
(S T)(u)=S(T u)
$$
for $u \in U$

\thrm{Algebraic Properties of products of linear maps}
\textbf{associativity}
$$
\left(T_{1} T_{2}\right) T_{3}=T_{1}\left(T_{2} T_{3}\right)
$$
whenever $T_{1}, T_{2},$ and $T_{3}$ are linear maps such that the products make sense (meaning that $T_{3}$ maps into the domain of $T_{2},$ and $T_{2}$ maps into the domain of $T_{1}$ ).
\textbf{identity}
$$
T I=I T=T
$$
whenever $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$ (the first $I$ is the identity map on $V,$ and the second $I$ is the identity map on $W$ ).
\textbf{distributive properties}
$$
\left(S_{1}+S_{2}\right) T=S_{1} T+S_{2} T \quad \text { and } \quad S\left(T_{1}+T_{2}\right)=S T_{1}+S T_{2}
$$
whenever $T, T_{1}, T_{2} \in \mathcal{L}(U, V)$ and $S, S_{1}, S_{2} \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$

\thrm{Linear maps take 0 to 0}
Suppose $T$ is a linear map from $V$ to $W .$ Then $T(0)=0$
