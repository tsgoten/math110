\mysection{Section 2.B Bases}

\defi{basis}
A basis of $V$ is a list of vectors in $V$ that is linearly independent and spans $V$

\thrm{Criterion for basis}
A list $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{n}$ of vectors in $V$ is a basis of $V$ if and only if every $v \in V$ can be written uniquely in the form
$
\quad v=a_{1} v_{1}+\cdots+a_{n} v_{n}
$
where $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n} \in \mathbf{F}$

\thrm{Spanning list contains a basis}
Every spanning list in a vector space can be reduced to a basis of the vector space.

\thrm{Linearly independent list extends to a basis}
Every linearly independent list of vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space can be extended to a basis of the vector space.

\thrm{Every subspace $ V $ is part of a direct sum equal to $ V $.}
Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $U$ is a subspace of $V .$ Then there is a subspace $W$ of $V$ such that $V=U \oplus W$
