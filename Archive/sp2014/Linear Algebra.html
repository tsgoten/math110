<h2>Catalog description</h2>

<h4>Textbook</h4>
At Cal, we tend to use
two textbooks for our Math 110 courses:
<a href="http://www.axler.net/">Sheldon Axler</a>'s
<a href="http://linear.axler.net/">Linear
Algebra Done Right</a> (LADR) and
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0130084514/">Linear Algebra</a>
by Friedberg, Insel and Spence.
Both are excellent.
<p>
This semester, we will be class-testing the
brand new
<i>third</i>
edition of LADR.
See the author's
<a href="https://twitter.com/AxlerLinear">twitter feed</a>
for some background on the new edition, which is a complete
re-write of the book that we have been using in previous
semesters.
The book will be available
for download
as a collection of
.pdf files.
For those who prefer paper to pixels, the book
will be sold (starting January 21)
as a black-and-white course reader for $25 + tax at
Copy Central, 2576 Bancroft Way.
</p><p>
If you spot an error in LADR, check the
<a href="http://linear.axler.net/errata3.html">list of known errors</a>
before
<a href="mailto:linear@axler.net">contacting</a> the author.
</p><p>
Axler's book
was based partly on ideas from
his article
<a href="http://www.axler.net/DwD.html"><i>Down with Determinants!</i></a>,
which is fun to read.







</p><p>

</p><h2>Examinations</h2>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/110/mt1_sols.pdf">First
midterm exam</a>, Thursday, February 20, 2014, in class;
</li><li> <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/110/mt2_sols.pdf">Last
midterm exam</a>, Thursday, April 3, 2014, in class (covered material
discussed through the March 20 lecture), max score=27,
mean=11.42, standard deviation=6.16;
</li><li> <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/110/final_sols.pdf">Final
examination</a>, Wednesday, May 14, 2014, 11:30AM-2:30PM
in 230 Hearst Gym;
mean = 16.85, standard deviation = 10.81.
</li></ul>
Please do not plan travel on the dates of these exams.
If you believe that you have a conflicting obligation because of an
intercollegiate sport or other
extracurricular activity,
please read
<a href="http://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/committees/cep/guidelines_acadschedconflicts_july2006.pdf">these
guidelines</a>
immediately.
<p>
For each exam, you may bring in a single 2-sided 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of
paper with your notes for the exam.  The opportunity
to create your page of notes will likely
guide your review of the material for the exam.
</p><h4>For practice</h4>
I seem to have taught Math 110 five times before:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/110/f02/">Fall, 2002</a>: this was a
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=32506066&amp;l=cbee13c8e6&amp;id=1246113">fairly
large</a> course in 3 LeConte;
</li><li><a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/110/f03/">Fall, 2003</a>: this was the honors section of
Math 110;
</li><li><a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/110/spring_05.html">Spring, 2005</a>: this was a large class in
10 Evans;
</li><li><a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/110/f08">Fall, 2008</a>: this was a class
using Linear Algebra Done Right,
but it was taught to a class of about 35 students;
</li><li><a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/110/spring_10.html">Spring, 2010</a>: this was a large class in
10 Evans.
</li></ul>
Each course page should have links
to problems and solutions for
the exams in the course.
Note that some midterms were 50 minutes long while others were
80 minutes long.


<h2>Grading</h2>
Course grades
will be based on a composite numerical score
that is intended to weight 
the course components roughly as follows:
midterm exams 17% each, homework
20%, final exam 46%.
<p>
According to the
<a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/calendar.html#January13">College
academic calendar</a>, the last day to add or drop this course is
Friday, February 21, i.e., the day after the first midterm.
Please consult this calendar as well for the deadline to change
your grading option to P/NP.
</p><p>
<a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/igrades.html">Incomplete
grades</a> will be assigned only to students for whom a documented
medical, personal or family emergency precludes completion of the course.
Students receiving such grades are required to have been doing work
of passing quality up to the occurrence of the emergency.

</p><p>
You can find the
<a href="https://schedulebuilder.berkeley.edu/explore/courses/FL/2013/518">composite
grade distribution</a> for this course
from 
<a href="https://schedulebuilder.berkeley.edu/">ScheduleBuilder</a>.
I checked and think that the grade distribution has been as follows:
36% A, 34% B, 21% C, 9% D/F.
Note that many students who receive an F grade have effectively dropped
the course after the add/drop deadline.

Note that (fairly light) homework assignments will be due on
February 19 and April 2, even though there's an exam the next day.
The assignments in those cases will be partially in the nature of
a review.
<p>
Each assignment will be worth 10 points.  Your homework grade will
be the sum of your twelve highest grades and half of your
next-to-lowest grade.  Accordingly, the maximum possible homework
grade will be 125; we are "dropping" 1 1/2 assignments in computing
your score.
